## ORATOR - _Your Desktop Assistant_

This project is a desktop assistant named Orator. It comes in with a mordernised Graphical User Interface (GUI) with a lot of great features to ease the work at your desktop.

## WORKING / FEATURES

The assistant can use your microphone as an input and take commands, we made this assistant able to take the inputs from a keyboard as well for the sake of versatility of this project. The commands consists of various actions such as opening any specific website on your computer, opening any other application on the computer, writing down notes, searching something on the wikipedia, and a lot more. We made this application a lot more comfortable for the user as when you start the application, Orator greets you according to your timezone and asks how are you doing! Talking of timezones, yes you can also ask the current date and time or the current month and year. If that's not enough, Orator can tell you jokes and even random facts! Considering youtube as one of the most used websites on the world wide web, we also added a functionality to search anything specifically on youtube just by telling Orator to do it. If we talk about the User interface, the default colour theme of the interface is already decent but you can also choose your favouriate theme with your favouriate colour combinations. Now you might be wondering if this application will be running in the background, well you can definitely toggle it from the settings page in our application to make Orator stop listening to you.
